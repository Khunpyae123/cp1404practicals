# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

To improve my understanding of lists, tuples, dictionaries, and classes, I have started to regularly watch the course videos and supplement them with extra web research.  My understanding and problem-solving skills have greatly improved as a result of this consistent involvement.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I want to spend more time working on challenging issues that call for combining different ideas—like lists, dictionaries, and exception handling—into a single project.  I also need to be more proactive in asking for help when I run into problems, making use of online resources, and contacting teachers and fellow students.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

One of my study routine's strong points is still how well I use Git for version control.  By facilitating frequent commits with unambiguous messages, simple change tracking, teamwork, and reverting to previous iterations as needed, it has expedited my process.  This systematic technique maintains the organization and documentation of my code repositories.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to start managing my projects on my own and stop depending solely on tutorials.  Directly interacting with real-world applications will improve my comprehension and memory of programming ideas.  I also need to start assignments early in order to combat my procrastination tendencies and lessen stress at the last minute.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

More interdisciplinary projects that connect programming to other fields, such web development or data analysis, would be appreciated.  The learning process would be enhanced by this interdisciplinary approach, which would also better prepare us for a variety of professional difficulties.
