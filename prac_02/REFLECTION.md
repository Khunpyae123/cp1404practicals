# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

I've completed watching around 65% of the lecture content, skipping only the sections I feel confident in. This helps me focus more on areas where I need to strengthen my understanding.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

The ideal time for me to watch the lectures is usually in the evening. Depending on how long the videos are and how much I need to watch, I allot flexible time intervals of roughly an hour for each session.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I'm skilled at decomposing code issues and creating methodical solutions. This has been especially useful for comprehending the practicals, and I'll keep improving this tactic to make it even more effective.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I should take my time when coding because I occasionally forget little things, which can result in mistakes. I can prevent problems later on if I take the time to review and improve my code.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I've come to the realization that I frequently spend too much time on minor details of a task. To make sure I stay on course and finish projects more quickly, I'll start utilizing time management strategies.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I understand how to apply code solutions for the practicals fairly well. My ability to spot issues fast and use the appropriate coding methods to address them is my strength. I intend to maintain this by also getting better at documenting my efforts.
