**CP1404 Practical Exercises - Programming II**

**Overview**
This repository contains practical exercises for CP1404 - Programming II, aiming to strengthen skills in object-oriented programming (OOP), clean code techniques, and fundamental software development principles. The tasks are designed to improve coding proficiency, with a focus on the creation of classes, file handling, and applying design best practices using Python.

**Practical 07 - Classes and Object-Oriented Design**
Practical 07 builds upon prior knowledge of classes, expanding into more intricate OOP design patterns and practices, especially for managing multiple objects and interacting with data files. Below is an outline of the main files associated with this practical:

**File Descriptions**
- **guitar.py**: Defines the Guitar class with attributes such as name, year, and cost. It includes methods to calculate a guitar's age, check if it's vintage, and support sorting by year.
- **language_file_reader.py**: This script reads data on programming languages from a file, creates instances of the ProgrammingLanguage class (defined in programming_language.py), and displays the data.
- **myguitar.py**: Utilizes the Guitar class to load, display, and manage a list of guitars from guitars.csv. This script includes functions for sorting guitars by age, adding new entries, and saving updates to the file.
- **programming_language.py**: Contains the ProgrammingLanguage class, modeling attributes such as typing, reflection, pointer arithmetic, and year of creation. It helps analyze programming languages based on these properties.
- **project_management.py**: A project management tool that loads and handles a list of Project objects. It supports displaying projects, filtering by start date, updating completion status, and saving project data to files.
- **project.py**: Defines the Project class with attributes such as name, start date, priority, completion percentage, and cost. The class includes methods for checking project completion status and updating project details.

**Key Lessons on Clean Code**
The CP1404 subject highlights several core clean code principles:
- **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Using descriptive and consistent names throughout the code improves readability and makes maintenance easier.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Dividing functionality into clearly defined methods and classes that focus on a single task enhances clarity and modularity.
- **Robust Error Handling and Validation**: Ensuring the program handles unexpected input smoothly improves both user experience and software reliability.

**Resources**
For further support and information:
- **Programming Patterns**: A resource detailing the programming patterns used in CP1404.
- **CP1404 Practicals Repository**: The official repository containing instructions and resources for CP1404 practical exercises.

**Formatting**
Before committing any code, ensure it meets best practices for formatting. PyCharmâ€™s "Reformat Code" tool can assist in maintaining consistent formatting.
